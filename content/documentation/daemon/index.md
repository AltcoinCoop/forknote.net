##Command line options and settings options

Option | Description
-----------|-----------|
log-file | A name of log file that you want to use for logging.
log-level | Level of logging. Default is 1.
no-console | Disable daemon console commands
testnet | Used to deploy test nets. Checkpoints and hardcoded seeds are ignored, network id is --data-dir flag. The wallet must be launched with --testnet flag.
rpc-bind-ip | Specify ip to bind rpc server
rpc-bind-port | Specify port to bind rpc server
p2p-bind-ip | Interface for p2p network protocol
p2p-bind-port | Port for p2p network protocol
p2p-external-port | External port for p2p network protocol (if port forwarding used with NAT)
add-peer | Manually add peer to local peerlist
add-priority-node | Specify list of peers to connect to and attempt to keep the connection open
add-exclusive-node | Specify list of peers to connect to only. If this option is given the options add-priority-node and seed-node are ignored
seed-node | Connect to a node to retrieve peer addresses, and disconnect
hide-my-port | Do not announce yourself as peerlist candidate
extra-messages-file | Specify file for extra messages to include into coinbase transactions
start-mining | Specify wallet address to mining for
mining-threads | Specify mining threads count
enable-cors | Adds header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' to the daemon's RPC responses
enable-blockchain-indexes | Enable blockchain indexes

##Blockchain options

Option | Description
-----------|-----------|
BYTECOIN_NETWORK | Used for network packages in order not to mix two different cryptocoin networks
CHECKPOINT | Checkpoints. Format: HEIGHT:HASH
CRYPTONOTE_BLOCK_GRANTED_FULL_REWARD_ZONE | The maximum size of a block not resulting into penelty.
CRYPTONOTE_BLOCK_GRANTED_FULL_REWARD_ZONE_V1 | The maximum size of a block not resulting into penelty. Used by (v1) blockchains
CRYPTONOTE_BLOCK_GRANTED_FULL_REWARD_ZONE_V2 | The maximum size of a block not resulting into penelty. Used by (v2) blockchains
CRYPTONOTE_COIN_VERSION | Use '1' for Cryptonote coin clones (the new version)
CRYPTONOTE_DISPLAY_DECIMAL_POINT | 1 coin = 10^(this value) atomic units
CRYPTONOTE_MINED_MONEY_UNLOCK_WINDOW | Number of blocks to unlock miner transactions
CRYPTONOTE_NAME | Cryptonote name. Used for storage directory
CRYPTONOTE_PUBLIC_ADDRESS_BASE58_PREFIX | Prefix of the wallet address. Since the rules for address prefixes are nontrivial you may use a prefix generator
DEFAULT_DUST_THRESHOLD | The amount bellow this value will be considered as dust
DIFFICULTY_CUT | Timestamps to cut after sorting
DIFFICULTY_CUT_V1 | Timestamps to cut after sorting. Used by (v1) blockchains
DIFFICULTY_CUT_V2 | Timestamps to cut after sorting. Used by (v2) blockchains
DIFFICULTY_LAG | Lag of calculating the difficulty in terms of blocks
DIFFICULTY_LAG_V1 | Lag of calculating the difficulty in terms of blocks. Used by (v1) blockchains
DIFFICULTY_LAG_V2 | Lag of calculating the difficulty in terms of blocks. Used by (v2) blockchains
DIFFICULTY_TARGET | Difficulty target is an ideal time period between blocks. Measured in seconds.
DIFFICULTY_WINDOW | Window length for calculation the difficulty
DIFFICULTY_WINDOW_V1 | Window length for calculation the difficulty. Used by (v1) blockchains
DIFFICULTY_WINDOW_V2 | Window length for calculation the difficulty. Used by (v2) blockchains
EMISSION_SPEED_FACTOR | Constant defines emission curve slope. This parameter is required to calulate block reward.
EXPECTED_NUMBER_OF_BLOCKS_PER_DAY | Expected number of blocks per day. Used to correct errors
GENESIS_BLOCK_REWARD | Amount of premined coins. In atomic units
GENESIS_COINBASE_TX_HEX | The hex of the transaction in the genesis block
KILL_HEIGHT | End blockchain at height
MANDATORY_MIXIN_BLOCK_VERSION | Enforce minimum mixin MIN_MIXIN on blockchain level, after block with major version bigger than MANDATORY_MIXIN_BLOCK_VERSION
MANDATORY_TRANSACTION | Only blocks with more than 1 transactions are valid (exluding the base transaction)
MAX_BLOCK_SIZE_INITIAL | The size of the initial block. Used to correct error in v1 coins
MIN_MIXIN | minimum mixin amount. Not enforced by default on blockchain level
MINIMUM_FEE | Transactions with less than this fee wouldn't be accepted by daemons
MIXIN_START_HEIGHT | minimum block height of the used outputs for mixin
MONEY_SUPPLY | Total amount of coins to be emitted.
P2P_STAT_TRUSTED_PUB_KEY | P2P stat trusted pub key
TAIL_EMISSION_REWARD | Block reward will never drop below this value.
UPGRADE_HEIGHT_V2 | Block hight to move to blocks with major version 2. Use '1' for new blockchains
UPGRADE_HEIGHT_V3 | Block hight to move to blocks with major version 3. Use '2' for new blockchains
ZAWY_DIFFICULTY_BLOCK_INDEX | Activates Zawy difficulty after certain block height
