# Cryptonote generator overview

* TOC
{:toc}

The Cryptonote generator is a collection of scripts for creating and maintaining a Bytecoin clone. The code produced by it have the same properties as its Forknote equivalent.


## How it works

Instead of merging the changes from the seed into the clone, the Cryptonote genetor applies changes to the latest version of the seed.

## Core parameters

Parameter | Description
SEED_NODES | Array of seed nodes
CHECKPOINTS | Array of checkpoints. See the example for the format
GENESIS_COINBASE_TX_HEX | The hex of the transaction in the genesis block
CRYPTONOTE_PUBLIC_ADDRESS_BASE58_PREFIX | Prefix of the wallet address. Since the rules for address prefixes are nontrivial you may use a prefix generator
MONEY_SUPPLY | Total amount of atomic units to be emitted.
EMISSION_SPEED_FACTOR | Constant defines emission curve slope. This parameter is required to calulate block reward.
DIFFICULTY_TARGET | Difficulty target is an ideal time period between blocks. Measured in seconds.
GENESIS_BLOCK_REWARD | Premine amount. Measured in atomic units.
CRYPTONOTE_BLOCK_GRANTED_FULL_REWARD_ZONE | The maximum size of a block not resulting into penelty.
CRYPTONOTE_BLOCK_GRANTED_FULL_REWARD_ZONE_V1 | The maximum size of a block not resulting into penelty. Used only by old (v1) blockchains
CRYPTONOTE_BLOCK_GRANTED_FULL_REWARD_ZONE_V2 | The maximum size of a block not resulting into penelty. Used only by old (v2) blockchains
CRYPTONOTE_DISPLAY_DECIMAL_POINT | 1 coin = 10^(this value) atomic units
MINIMUM_FEE | Transactions with less than this fee wouldn't be accepted by daemons
DEFAULT_DUST_THRESHOLD | The amount bellow this value will be considered as dust
CRYPTONOTE_MINED_MONEY_UNLOCK_WINDOW | Number of blocks to unlock miner transactions
MAX_BLOCK_SIZE_INITIAL | The size of the initial block. Used to correct error in v1 blockchains
EXPECTED_NUMBER_OF_BLOCKS_PER_DAY | Expected number of blocks per day. Used to correct error in v1 blockchains
UPGRADE_HEIGHT_V2 | Block hight to move to blocks with major version 2. Use '1' for new blockchains
UPGRADE_HEIGHT_V3 | Block hight to move to blocks with major version 3. Use '2' for new blockchains
DIFFICULTY_CUT | Timestamps to cut after sorting
DIFFICULTY_LAG | Lag of calculating the difficulty in terms of blocks
